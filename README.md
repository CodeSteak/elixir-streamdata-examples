# Property-Based Testing In Elixir

This demo is based around [`StreamData v0.5.0`](https://github.com/whatyouhide/stream_data), 
an Elixir library for property-based testing and test data generation. Elixir 
version `1.13.0` is used for all examples. 

It's structured in 3 parts. Each provides it's own README for more information.
 * [`01_hello_world`](01_hello_world) shows very basic usage and setup.
 * [`02_parallel_merge_sort`](02_parallel_merge_sort) provides the main examples in the slides of the 
    presentation and compares approaches.
 * [`03_json_parser`](03_json_parser) implements a JSON-Parser as show case. It uses more advanced
    data generation for testing. First serializable data is generated, then it 
    is feed in a tokenizer that produces JSON, then whitespace between tokens is
    added. The generated JSON-string is feed into the parser. It is checked if 
    the parser matches the initial serializable data.
